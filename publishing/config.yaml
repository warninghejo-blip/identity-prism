      short_description: Solana wallet identity card
      long_description: |-
        Identity Prism transforms your Solana wallet activity into a living identity card. It analyzes transactions, holdings, NFTs, DeFi positions, and wallet age to produce a reputation score (0–1400), a celestial tier (Mercury → Binary Sun), and achievement badges that represent your true on-chain identity.
        Features: • Reputation Score — composite score based on SOL balance, wallet age, transaction count,
          NFT holdings, DeFi activity, and special assets.
        • Celestial Tiers — from Mercury (new wallets) through Mars, Earth, Saturn, Jupiter,
          to Sun (top-tier OGs). Holders of both Seeker Genesis + Chapter 2 Preorder earn
          the rare Binary Sun tier.
        • Achievement Badges — OG, Whale, Collector, Titan, Maxi, Seeker, Visionary, Early
          Adopter, and more.
        • 3D Identity Card — stunning Three.js-powered celestial card with interactive planet
          rendering based on your tier.
        • Mint as NFT — mint your identity card as a Metaplex Core NFT on Solana. • Solana Blinks — share and attest your identity via Solana Actions. • Tapestry Social Graph — publish identity profiles for cross-app reputation discovery. • Reputation API — public REST API for any dApp to query wallet reputation. • AI Twitter Agent — autonomous bot analyzing on-chain identity and posting insights.
      new_in_version: 'v3.2: Improved 3D card rendering, Tapestry social graph integration, on-chain attestation via Solana Actions, AI-powered Twitter agent, enhanced scoring algorithm.'
      saga_features: Native Mobile Wallet Adapter support for seamless wallet connection on Saga and Seeker devices. Full MWA integration for signing and minting directly from the app.
