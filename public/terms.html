      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

      <h2>Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        Identity Prism is a non-custodial Solana dApp that visualizes public blockchain data. You are
        responsible for all actions taken with your wallet and for verifying any on-chain transaction.
        We do not request or store your private keys or seed phrase.
      </p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use the
        service. By using Identity Prism, you represent that you meet this requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>Wallet Connections</h2>
      <p>
        When you connect a wallet, you authorize the app to read your public address and related
        blockchain data. You can disconnect your wallet at any time from your wallet provider.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The app integrates with third-party wallet providers and RPC infrastructure. We are not
        responsible for the availability, security, or performance of those services.
      </p>

      <h2>Prohibited Activities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the service for unlawful purposes or to violate third-party rights.</li>
        <li>Attempting to disrupt, exploit, or reverse engineer the application or its infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Submitting fraudulent or malicious data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User Content & Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        If you provide feedback, ideas, or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide,
        royalty-free license to use them to improve the service. You remain responsible for any
        content you publish on third-party platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        Identity Prism, its visuals, branding, and code are owned by the publisher. You may not copy,
        redistribute, or modify the app or its assets without permission.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

        Identity Prism is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. The app does not provide
        financial or investment advice.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the publisher is not liable for any indirect or
        consequential damages arising from your use of the service.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access to the service if you violate these terms or if required
        to comply with legal obligations. You may stop using the service at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of the publisher's jurisdiction, without regard to
        conflict of law principles.
      </p>

      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Disputes should first be sent to us at the contact email below. If we cannot resolve the
        issue, disputes will be handled in the courts of the publisher's jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

        We may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time. Continued use of the app indicates
