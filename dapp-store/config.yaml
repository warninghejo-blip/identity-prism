      short_description: On-chain identity on Solana
      long_description: |
        Identity Prism scans any Solana wallet and builds a cosmic identity card with
        real on-chain data. Your tier (Mercury → Binary Sun) is determined by SOL balance,
        wallet age, transaction history, NFT holdings, and behavioral traits like Diamond
        Hands, DeFi King, Meme Lord, and Hyperactive Degen.

        Features:
        - 3D interactive planet visualization matching your tier
        - Orbit Survival — dodge asteroids and black holes in a skill-based arcade game,
          commit high scores on-chain via Memo transactions with MagicBlock session proofs
        - Mint your identity as a compressed NFT (cNFT) — pay with SOL or SKR (50% off)
        - Black Hole token burner — warp into a 3D black hole and burn unwanted SPL tokens
        - Solana Actions & Blinks — share your card as an interactive link
        - Space curtain reveal transition after scanning
        - OG badges for Seeker Genesis and Chapter 2 Preorder holders
        - Share to Twitter with auto-generated card image
        - Full Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) support for Seeker
        - All transactions simulate before prompting to sign — no wasted approvals

        Built for the Solana community — collectors, degens, builders, and explorers.

  testing_instructions: |
    1. Open the app and connect any Solana wallet via MWA (Seeker recommended).
    2. Wait for the scan — the space curtain should open to reveal the card.
    3. Verify the 3D planet matches the wallet tier (e.g. high-score wallets get Sun/Jupiter).
    4. Flip to back to view stats tab and badges tab.
    5. Tap "Black Hole" portal on the card to enter the token burner — select any SPL token and burn it.
    6. Tap Mint to mint a cNFT identity card. Try dismissing the wallet prompt to verify instant cancel detection.
    7. Use Share to verify the Twitter share with card image works.
    8. Tap the game icon to enter Orbit Survival — tap/space to reverse orbit direction.
    9. After game over, try "Save Score On-Chain" with zero balance — verify insufficient SOL warning appears.
    10. Test wallet: 2psA2ZHmj8miBjfSqQdjimMCSShVuc2v6yUpSLeLr4RN (Binary Sun tier, score 1140).
